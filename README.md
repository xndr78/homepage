# My fabulous homepage

Source files for my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo website")-powered static homepage, hosted currently on GitHub Pages. 

Deployed automatically on push to `master` by [hugo-remote](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-remote) action. It basically builds hugo project, then commits and pushes all files to another repository with GitHub Pages environment. Current build is always here: [github.com/xndr78/xndr78.github.io](https://github.com/xndr78/xndr78.github.io)

Final result: https://xndr.name
